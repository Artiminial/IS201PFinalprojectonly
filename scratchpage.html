        <H1>A little bit about myself</H1>
        <p>My full name is Hector Jeremiah casablanca. I was born in Gainesville Florida on  July 9th, 1999.
             I have three brothers, and two sisters, of which I am the oldest. Throughout most of my life, 
             my family has been moving from place to place. I first started out in Gainesville, then the family
              moved to West Palm Beach, then Ocala, then Tampa, then Orlando. Over the 13 years of my life that 
              were spent in Florida, I can remember many fond memories of Disney world, six flags, Legoland and 
              many other nature-based or theme park based Retreats that our family loved to go on throughout my 
              youth. I also remember  the natural disasters that frequently swept through Florida, most vividly 
              tropical storm Fey. I remember it mostly because it kept me from going to school for a solid week 
              as it dumped rain Over The Floridian peninsula, but looking back on it, I think it was one of the 
              first things in nature that gave me a healthy respect for its power and beauty.  I also remember 
              a fair bit of my friends who lived there, many of whom now live in utah. I remember the fun that 
              we used to have running around and high grass and Cattail strewn backyards as we pretended to be 
              dump truck drivers, delivering payloads of clay and dirt from the  edge of a soggy Marsh to a small
                mudfort that we had built on top of a hill. I remember that it was a very carefree and simple 
                life that I lived, with my only troubles being School, and getting caught sneaking into the Jif
                 peanut butter after everyone had gone to sleep.
        </p>
        <p>After 13 Years of Living in multiple areas around  florida, our family picked up and moved to texas.
             I remember that it was a very long road trip and that, since our little sister had just been born,
              a very loud one as well. I remember getting to Texas and marveling at how hot  the air was. I 
              remember the house that we lived in, how it was the biggest house I had ever seen, and how it 
              had enough bedrooms and bathrooms to give us all our own independent rooms. I remember, after a 
              few days of  breaking in the house, my dad and I going to a  large storage compartment and one of
               those Self Storage Lots. When we got there,  my dad seemed a little annoyed after he had finished 
               a call. After opening up the storage compartment, he looked at me and said “Well,  it looks like the
                moving company that we paid didn't include the  service of taking our furniture and belongings and
                 unloading them into our house, so it looks like it's up to us.”.  I remember that day is a very 
                 very long one, full of dressers,  pianos, and dining table sets. All in all, it was a very appropriate
                  kickoff to the 3 years that I lived in texas. I made many friends there, some of whom I keep in contact
                   with, some of whom have disappeared off the face of the Earth. I learned a lot about the quality of
                    people and how to spot warning signs, and that skill has served me greatly to this day. I also remember
                     that Moving into Texas started my days as a high schooler.  it was all a very big blur, but it was a 
                     fun Journey, making friends, growing up, and at least learning somewhat the way the world worked. 
        </p>
   
        <p>
            After 3 years in texas, my family then moved to Atlanta. I finished up my high school degree there, finished
             up my Eagle Scout project there, and proceeded to go on a mission.  I was called to Reno Nevada  to serve as 
             a full-time missionary for 2 years. and honesty, I was scared. it was a new experience to be away from my 
             family for such a long period of time. at the time, we were only allowed to contact our families twice a year
              and so mentally preparing myself was quite difficult to say the least.
